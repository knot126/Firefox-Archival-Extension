# Firefox Archival Extension

This extension will intercept EVERY request available to the web requests API and try to download it. It's very hacky but should be able to download even things normally reserved for AJAX!

If possible, I would suggest that you look for another, better written and more user friendly extension. I only wrote this because I couldn't find one.
